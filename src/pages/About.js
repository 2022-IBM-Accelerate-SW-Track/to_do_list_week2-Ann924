              My name is Ann Li and I am a rising third-year 
              at the University of Virginia. I am a double major 
              in computer science and cognitive science. In college,
              I have gotten more involved in theoretical computer
                science. A fun fact about me is that I joined the UVA ballroom
                dance club without any ballroom experience.
